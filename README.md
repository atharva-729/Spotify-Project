## Spotify Data Exploration and Analysis

This repository contains three Jupyter Notebooks exploring my Spotify listening data and playlists. 

**Important Note:** Due to privacy concerns, the notebooks do not contain any actual user data or personal information, including:

* Raw Spotify data (listening history, playlists, etc.) 
* Spotify API Client ID and Secret (required for notebooks using the Spotify API) 

**Project Overview**

These notebooks delve into my Spotify listening habits, using data science techniques to uncover trends, patterns, and insights into my musical preferences. 

**Notebooks:**

1. **`Spotify-EDA.ipynb`**
   * This notebook focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of my Spotify tracks and podcasts. 
   * It includes various plots and visualizations to analyze listening patterns, top songs/artists, genre distribution, and track features.

2. **`Playlist-EDA.ipynb`**
   * Similar to the first notebook, this notebook performs EDA on my Spotify playlists. 
   * It explores playlist characteristics, common genres, and song popularity within playlists.

3. **`Playlist (API).ipynb`**
   * This notebook utilizes the Spotify API to extract playlist data and perform similar analysis as `Playlist-EDA.ipynb`. 
   * Note that you will need to replace the placeholder values with your own Spotify API Client ID and Secret for the notebook to function.

**Data Source**

The data analyzed in `Spotify-EDA.ipynb` was obtained through a personal Spotify data export. No actual data files are included in this repository.

**Project Documentation**

A detailed explanation of the analysis, findings, and visualizations from these notebooks can be found in a blog post on Medium: [From Playlists to Patterns: Analyzing My Spotify Listening History](https://medium.com/@sharmaatharva2420/from-playlists-to-patterns-analyzing-my-spotify-listening-history-0d9f7abef853)

**Feel free to:**

* Explore the code and logic behind the analysis.
* Adapt the notebooks to analyze your own Spotify data (instructions for obtaining data exports and API credentials can be found on the Spotify developer website).
* Share your findings and insights!
